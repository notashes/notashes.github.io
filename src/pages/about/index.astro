    I am a system engineer by heart and love to build things that are closer to these sillicon systems that govern our world.

    I love open-source software and self-hosting. In fact, I've been managing my own self-hosted media server of sorts for the last four years.

    An about me section wouldn't be complete without mentining my new-found love for reading. It started with a classic - Stoner by John Williams,
    however I soon found myself unable to hold back from the beautiful worlds of speculative fiction. And you get all sorts of variety. From Neal Stephenson's
    <i>Anathem</i> to Ursula K. Le Guin's <i>The Dispossessed</i>, and Robin Hobb's <i>Assassin's Apprentice</i> - I could go on and on...
